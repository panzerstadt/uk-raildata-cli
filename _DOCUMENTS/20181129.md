diff two arrays to matching interchange station
different icon for interchange station
split line and offset line at the row (routeline)

DONE
tap back, goes back to home (react native router flux)

no history because not calling transportAPI



switches at Ingatestone

match the last match

2 things
- find the interchange station
	- interchange icon
- pick the line with the target destination
	- line after interchange offsets right
	- with the first list item that has an extra gray dotted line on left

second train should split at Ingatestone
third train should split at the first (current) station
fourth train should split at Stratford(London) - one stops at london
fifth train should not be affected, but have 2 previousCallingPoints
sixth train should not be affected, but have 2 previousCallingPoints (reversed)
eigth is an error
